Reboot, testing ability to load flat files into a MySQL database. Changed as little as possible to get it loaded.

* Updated README
* Commented out the socket
* Changed user and password to something more generic than root. Suspect this will conflict with the constants in the script file, may attempt to have them refrence the database.yml down the road.
* Added documentation and stubs to .gitignore
